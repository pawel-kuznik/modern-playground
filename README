# Modern web playground

This repo is my own webstack with modern (as lately released) web languages 
(PHP7 and ES6). However lot of stuff is already done, the ansible playbook,
gruntfile and simple vagrant config, it's a barebone. So, there are no frameworks,
libs or other stuff. 

# Installation

Couple of packages are required to be installed on host system.  That would be:
virtualbox (for actual machine virtualization), vagrant (for setting up the vm)
and ansible (for orchestrating the guest system).

All of the needed packeges can be found inside your preffered operating system 
with apt. Just run following commands:


```
apt-get install virtualbox vagrant ansible

```

Windows and Mac users are out of luck. I don't have a Mac to play around and I use 
my Windows only for playing games. So no support from me.

# Usage

PHP7 is installed, but there is no environment set up. So the freedom of creating
applications however you want is yours. (Still composer is really advised).

ES6 is achieved with babel.js. Whole package is using babel 6 (so also latest 
release) with es2015 preset. Babel is just transpiling files, it doesn't merge 
them nor deploy any module system. So, for using commonJS modules we are using 
browserify that will use node.js-like module discovery and compile the whole thing
into one es5 file. That final file can be used on a website.
